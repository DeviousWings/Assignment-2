<h1>What I learned</h1>

1. I learned about how to create a web bage from the logo positioning, nav bar, body, and the footer. What should go in each section and how to make a website that looks pleasing to the customers. 

2. I learned at the beginning of developing a web site you create a wireframes.

3. I learend how to interact the CSS stylesheet to HTML file.

The first part is a step by step creating a website for the assignment. Then use what I learned from that step by step to create my own website.

This class allowed me to explore how it really was being an HTML and CSS developer. I learned how to start a web site and what a customer may ask for their website to invite people to their product. 

Creating a website of my own I learned about the brainstorming needed. Starting off I first had to understand the mission of the website. What it was to do to invite people and keep people coming. I went to space because it is something I liked to study as a pass time. 

The Space Library (https://github.com/DeviousWings/Assignment-2/tree/master/SpaceSite) is a baby project. It is something I plan on developing into the mission statement stated in the About Us tab.

The Space Library was my final project for the class WDD 130. It was something I had to create on my own from the ground up

The wwr file was the project was the holding hand project the class had me do. It was a good start to help me understand the basics of website structure and helped show what each code can do to a website.
