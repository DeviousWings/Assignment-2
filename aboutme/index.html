        <h2>Nathanael King</h2>
        <h2>Nick name: Easter Egg</h2>
        <p>I am in the army reserves and have been for 6 years and 6 months. I am working on getting my BA degree in Science and Technology using the BYUI Pathway program and work in the Space Industry.
             My focus would be in the Research and Development in Software design and development. I might shoot for a Software Engineering Master’s degree, but I will see where this goes for now. 
             I was homeschooled all my life so sitting in a classroom never sat well with me. </p>

            <p>Web design always seemed kind of an arts thing to me, and I like drawing on occasions so I thought this would be fun thing to add to my degree path. I can see just a benefit to learning a 
            different language to excises your mind a little bit and see other avenues in the field of programming. If anything, this is a nice side gig.</p>

            <p>My hobbies include researching (funny), playing video games, and writing.</p>

            <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all my life. Served in Brazil Fortaleza Mission. I am still active to this day. My favorite quote is from 
            Elder Bednar when he talked about knowing if the promptings you get are from the Spirit or not. He said, “Be a good boy, be a good girl, and the rest will follow.” My favorite scripture 
            is Nephi 3:7.</p>

            <p>I am excited to learn with you guys. I have already been studying HTML 5 and CSS for a while. I am not an expert, but I know a few things and hope to learn more with everyone.</p>
